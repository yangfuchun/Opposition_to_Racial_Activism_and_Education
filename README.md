### Overview
This project aims to examine the opposition to two initiatives focused on addressing racial inequality in the United States - the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and incorporating information on the country's history of racial and ethnic oppression into school curriculum. Despite the United States' long history of racial injustice and conflict, there is ongoing disagreement and divisiveness around acknowledging and addressing racial discrimination, inequality, and the legacy of slavery. The project will investigate the reasons behind this opposition to these initiatives, which may include political ideologies, social and cultural beliefs, and systemic biases, among other factors by using statistical analyses and digestible data visualizations. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the barriers to progress in achieving racial equity and justice in the United States.
