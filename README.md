# Opposition-to-Racial-Activism-and-Education

The United States has a long history of racial injustice and conflict, and the country remains divided on its recognition and concern about racial discrimination, racial inequality, and the legacy of slavery. Though certainly not new, over the past several years, activism and pressure for social change to improve racial equity has been increasing and nationally focal. There has been resistance and counter-activism in reaction to these attempts at change. This paper will look at opposition to two activities geared toward recognizing and addressing racial inequality – the Black Lives matter Movement (BLM) and including information on the country’s history of racial and ethnic oppression in school curriculum.
